# RSNA Mammography Breast Cancer Detection
### Kaggle Competition: Top 68%
This project involves the use of deep learning for mammography image analysis to detect breast cancer.

## Key Features
- Applied image preprocessing techniques.
- Built convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify mammograms.
- Used augmentation and ensemble learning to improve performance.


## Data
Due to privacy, data is available only on [Kaggle RSNA Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-breast-cancer-detection/data).
